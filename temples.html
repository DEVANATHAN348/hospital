                The Shri Saneeswaran Temple, also known as the Temple of Saturn, is a prominent Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shani (Saneeswaran in Tamil), who is considered one of the nine celestial deities in Hindu astrology. This temple is primarily associated with the planet Saturn (Shani), and it is believed to be one of the most powerful places to seek blessings and protection from the adverse effects of Saturn's influence, particularly during the period known as "Sade Sati" in Vedic astrology.<br><br>
